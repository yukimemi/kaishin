## Shared conventions

This file is the agent-agnostic source of truth (per the
[agents.md](https://agents.md) convention). The matching
`CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md` files are thin shims that point back
here so each tool's auto-load behaviour still finds something.
**Edit AGENTS.md, not the shims.**

### Git workflow

- **No direct push to `main`.** Open a PR.
  - Exception: trivial typo / whitespace / docs wording fixes.
- Branch names: `feat/...`, `fix/...`, `chore/...`.
- **PR titles + bodies in English. Commit messages in English.**
- **Releases are PR-driven, tagging is automatic.** Bump
  `[workspace.package].version` (workspace) or `[package].version`
  (single crate) in a `chore/release-vX.Y.Z` PR. On merge to `main`,
  `.github/workflows/auto-tag.yml` (kata-managed) detects the bump,
  pushes the `vX.Y.Z` tag, and that tag fires `release.yml` for
  binary builds + crates.io publish. **Do not run `git tag` by
  hand** — the bot tag will collide and the manual push fails.

### PR review cycle

- Every PR runs reviews from **Gemini Code Assist** and
  **CodeRabbit**. Wait for both bots to post, address their
  comments (push fixes to the PR branch), and merge only after
  feedback is resolved.
- **After opening a PR, immediately enter the review-monitoring
  loop — do not ask the user whether to start it.** Drive the
  cadence with `/loop` — fixed-interval mode (e.g.
  `/loop 60s …`) schedules ticks via `CronCreate`; dynamic mode
  (no interval, `/loop …`) self-paces via `ScheduleWakeup`. The
  agent actively pulls fresh state each tick with
  `gh pr view <N> --json state,reviews,comments,statusCheckRollup`
  and `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<N>/comments` (the
  latter covers inline review comments, which `gh pr view`
  does not surface) and reacts to new bot feedback. Passive
  watchers (background `gh` polls, file watchers, hooks) cannot
  trigger active follow-up, so they are not a substitute —
  without an active wake-up the agent never re-reads the PR.
- **Default polling interval: 60s.** Gemini Code Assist /
  CodeRabbit historically reply within ~1–3 minutes of a push or
  thread reply, so a 60s tick catches them on the next wake-up
  without burning cache: 60s sits well inside the 5-minute
  prompt-cache TTL, so the conversation context stays cached
  across ticks. Do **not** stretch the interval to 300s — that
  is the worst-of-both window (you pay the cache miss without
  amortizing it). If the PR is idle but a bot re-review is still
  expected (e.g. a CodeRabbit rate-limit refill window), step
  **up** to 1200–1800s instead.
- **Stop the loop entirely when only owner approval is missing.**
  Once review bots are quiet (or quiet-by-exception — version-bump
  skip, Renovate/Dependabot skip), CI is green, and there is no
  other expected follow-up, the *only* remaining action is human
  approval. GitHub already notifies the owner; the agent
  re-entering on every cron tick to find the same "still waiting
  on owner" state burns cache and adds no value. Stop scheduling
  further wake-ups (`CronDelete` in fixed-interval mode; simply
  omit the next `ScheduleWakeup` in dynamic mode) and report the
  wait state to the user. The owner restarts the loop after their
  next push if a fresh bot pass is wanted, or merges directly.
  (A CodeRabbit rate-limit window doesn't qualify on its own — a
  re-review is still expected once the quota refills, so step up
  to 1200–1800s instead and let it ride. Stopping is only correct
  when the owner has explicitly chosen to skip the bot pass per
  the rate-limit exception below.)
- **Reply to reviewers after pushing a fix.** Reply on the
  corresponding review thread with an **@-mention**
  (`@gemini-code-assist` / `@coderabbitai`). Silent fixes are
  invisible to reviewers and cost the audit trail.
- A review thread is **settled** the moment the latest bot reply
  is ack-only ("Thank you" / "Understood" / a re-review summary
  with no new findings) or 30 minutes elapse with no actionable
  comment.
- **Merge gate**: review bots quiet AND owner explicit approval.
- Bot-authored PRs (Renovate / Dependabot) skip the bot-review
  gate; CI green + owner approval is enough.
- **Version-bump-only PRs** (a single `chore/release-vX.Y.Z`
  branch whose entire diff is `[workspace.package].version` /
  `[package].version` + the matching inter-crate refs +
  `Cargo.lock`) **also skip the bot-review gate.** There is
  nothing for the bots to find in a version bump, and the
  release pipeline downstream of merge (auto-tag → release.yml)
  is time-sensitive. CI green + owner approval is enough.
- **Treat CodeRabbit rate-limit notices as "quiet" for the
  merge gate.** If CodeRabbit only posts a "Review limit
  reached" quota-exhaustion message (no findings, no inline
  comments), it has produced no review content — there is
  nothing to address. Re-trigger with `@coderabbitai review`
  once the quota refills if you want a real pass; for small or
  time-sensitive PRs, merge on owner approval without waiting.

### Worktree workflow

Use [`renri`](https://github.com/yukimemi/renri) for any
commit-bound change. From the main checkout:

```sh
renri add <branch-name> --from main@origin            # create a worktree (jj-first), off latest upstream main
renri --vcs git add <branch-name> --from origin/main  # force a git worktree, off latest upstream main
renri remove <branch-name> -y --non-interactive  # cleanup after merge (agent-safe; see note)
renri prune                        # GC stale worktrees
```

Read-only inspection can stay on the main checkout.

**Always pass `--from <upstream main>`** (`main@origin` for jj,
`origin/main` for git). Without it, `renri add` forks off the *cwd
worktree's current HEAD* — in a long-lived main checkout that often
lags upstream, so the PR later shows up CONFLICTING against a `main`
that had already moved (e.g. a refactor merged upstream before the
branch was cut), forcing a manual re-port of the whole change.
`renri add` does fetch first, but fetching only updates `main@origin`
— it never moves the checkout's HEAD, so an explicit `--from` is what
guarantees a fresh base.

**Agents / non-interactive shells:** `renri remove` prints a details
panel and waits for a confirmation prompt — without `-y` it **hangs**,
and `--non-interactive` *alone* errors asking for `-y`. Always pass
`-y`, and add `--non-interactive` so a mistyped/omitted name fails
instead of opening a fuzzy picker (the same picker-fallback applies to
`remove` / `cd` / `exec` with no name). Use `-f`/`--force` to remove a
worktree that still has uncommitted changes or conflicts. To sweep
every merged-PR worktree in one shot: `renri remove --merged -y`.

### kata-managed sections

Several files in this repo are managed by `kata apply` from the
[`yukimemi/pj-presets`](https://github.com/yukimemi/pj-presets)
templates — the bytes between `<!-- kata:*:begin -->` and
`<!-- kata:*:end -->` markers, plus the overwrite-always files
listed in `.kata/applied.toml`. **Editing those bytes locally
won't survive the next `kata apply`** — push the change to the
upstream template repo (`yukimemi/pj-base` / `yukimemi/pj-rust` /
…) instead. The marker scopes are layered:

- `kata:agents:base:*` — language-agnostic conventions (this section).
- `kata:agents:rust:*` — added when `pj-rust` applies.
- `kata:agents:rust-cli:*` — added when `pj-rust-cli` applies.

### Rust workflow

This repo follows the shared Rust toolchain conventions. The
language-agnostic conventions block above (`kata:agents:base:*`)
covers git workflow, PR review cycle, and worktree usage.

### Build / lint / test

```sh
cargo make check                    # fmt --check + clippy + test + lock-check (the pre-push gate)
cargo make setup                    # one-time hook install + apm install
cargo build                         # debug build
cargo build --release               # release build
cargo test                          # tests; add -- --nocapture for stdout
```

`cargo make check` is what `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs and what
the local pre-push hook calls — anything that passes locally
should pass on CI and vice versa. Don't paper over a failing
clippy by sprinkling `#[allow(clippy::...)]`; fix the underlying
issue or push back on the lint with reasoning.

### Toolchain pin

The Rust toolchain is pinned via `rust-toolchain.toml` and the
project compiles with the `stable` channel. Don't introduce
nightly-only features without a real reason; if you do, document
the reason in the relevant module.

### Lint / format policy

`rustfmt.toml` and `clippy.toml` are kata-managed (sourced from
`yukimemi/pj-rust`). Edits to those files in this repo won't
survive the next `kata apply`; if a setting is wrong, push the
fix to `yukimemi/pj-rust` so every Rust project using these templates picks
it up.

### CI workflow

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` is also kata-managed. The source lives
in `yukimemi/pj-rust/.github/workflows/ci.yml.template` (the
`.template` suffix keeps GitHub Actions from running the source
itself in pj-rust); each Rust project receives the rendered
`ci.yml` via `kata apply`. Action versions are bumped centrally
by Renovate at `yukimemi/pj-rust` and propagate down on the next
apply, so don't bump them locally — Renovate is configured
(via the kata-distributed `renovate.json`) to ignore
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `.github/workflows/release.yml`
in each PJ to avoid the bump→clobber loop.

### Releasing: version bump PR + auto-tag

Releases are triggered from `main` by a Cargo.toml version
change. `.github/workflows/auto-tag.yml` is kata-managed (source:
`yukimemi/pj-rust/.github/workflows/auto-tag.yml.tera`). It
watches `main` and, whenever a commit lands that changes the
top-level `version = "..."` in `Cargo.toml`, it pushes a matching
`vX.Y.Z` tag — no manual `git tag` step is needed. The tag push
then fires `release.yml`; see `kata:agents:rust-lib:*` or
`kata:agents:rust-cli:*` for what release.yml does in each
crate shape.

Cut a release via a small PR — never `git push` the bump
straight to `main`, even though the base block lists version
bumps as an exception to "no direct push". `auto-tag.yml` only
fires on `main`-branch pushes, so the bump must land via a merge
either way; using a PR also gives CI a chance to gate the
release. Enable automerge so CI green = release start:

```sh
git switch -c chore/release-vX.Y.Z
# Edit `package.version` in Cargo.toml, then:
cargo build                     # let Cargo.lock follow
git commit -am "chore: release vX.Y.Z"
git push -u origin chore/release-vX.Y.Z
gh pr create --fill
gh pr merge --auto --squash --delete-branch
```

Once CI is green the PR auto-merges. `auto-tag.yml` then pushes
`vX.Y.Z`, which fires `release.yml`.

**Repo settings to set once:** enable
`delete_branch_on_merge=true` (Settings → General →
"Automatically delete head branches"). The `--delete-branch`
flag on `gh pr merge --auto` is effectively a no-op — gh
returns as soon as automerge is enabled, so the deletion has to
happen server-side, which requires the repo setting.

**Why `KATA_APPLY_TOKEN`:** GitHub refuses to fire downstream
workflows from tags pushed by the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`, so
`auto-tag.yml` pushes with `KATA_APPLY_TOKEN` (the same PAT
`kata-apply.yml` already uses). Each consumer repo needs a
`KATA_APPLY_TOKEN` secret set; if a version-bump merge silently
doesn't fire `release.yml`, the missing PAT is the first thing
to check.

<!-- kata:agents:rust-lib:begin -->
### Rust library release flow

This is a Rust **library** crate, so the release pipeline is
publish-only: a successful tag push runs `cargo publish` to
crates.io and stamps the matching GitHub release page with
auto-generated notes. **No binaries** are uploaded — the
canonical artifact for a library is the `crates.io` tarball;
the GH release page exists for historical visibility and so
Renovate's release-notes manager (and any other tooling that
consumes GitHub Releases) has something to find.

Releases are triggered by a Cargo.toml version bump landing on
`main`. The bump flow itself (PR with automerge → `auto-tag.yml`
pushes `vX.Y.Z` → `release.yml` runs) is documented in
`kata:agents:rust:*` under "Releasing: version bump PR +
auto-tag" — that block also covers the `KATA_APPLY_TOKEN` and
`delete_branch_on_merge` setup. What `release.yml` then does for
a **library** crate:

1. Creates a GitHub Release at the tag with auto-generated
   notes (PRs since the previous tag).
2. `cargo publish --locked` to crates.io using the
   `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` repo secret.

Set the `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` secret once per repo (`gh secret
set CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`) before the first release. If the
crate is internal-only and shouldn't go to crates.io, drop the
`publish` job locally (release.yml is `when = "once"` so the
edit survives subsequent applies) or set `package.publish = false`
in `Cargo.toml`.

### MSRV / SemVer caveats for library authors

Unlike CLIs (where lockfile-pinned versions are what users
consume), libraries publish version *ranges* in their downstream
projects' `Cargo.toml` files. Two things to keep in mind when
bumping:

- **MSRV signalling.** Setting `package.rust-version` in
  `Cargo.toml` tells cargo the minimum Rust this crate will
  build with. Bump it deliberately (e.g. when adopting a stable
  feature that requires a newer toolchain) and call out the bump
  in the release notes — downstream pinning their own MSRV
  needs the visibility.
- **`rangeStrategy` in renovate.json.** This template inherits
  pj-rust's `rangeStrategy: "bump"`, which is right for binary
  crates but raises the MSRV ceiling for library downstreams
  more than necessary. If a downstream of this library
  complains, override locally with `rangeStrategy: "replace"`
  (and consider whether the broader template default should
  flip — track upstream).

### `cargo publish --dry-run`

Before opening the version bump PR, validate the publish step
locally with `cargo make publish-dry` (defined by pj-rust).
Catches metadata issues — missing `description`, `license`,
`repository`, `readme` — that crates.io rejects on the actual
publish. Doing this before the PR is cheaper than catching it
post-merge, where the only recovery is bumping again.
