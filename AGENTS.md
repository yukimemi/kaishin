## yukimemi/* shared conventions

This file is the agent-agnostic source of truth (per the
[agents.md](https://agents.md) convention). The matching
`CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md` files are thin shims that point back
here so each tool's auto-load behaviour still finds something.
**Edit AGENTS.md, not the shims.**

### Git workflow

- **No direct push to `main`.** Open a PR.
  - Exception: trivial typo / whitespace / docs wording fixes.
  - Exception: standalone version bumps.
- Branch names: `feat/...`, `fix/...`, `chore/...`.
- **PR titles + bodies in English. Commit messages in English.**
- Tag-based releases: `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`.

### PR review cycle

- Every PR runs reviews from **Gemini Code Assist** and
  **CodeRabbit**. Wait for both bots to post, address their
  comments (push fixes to the PR branch), and merge only after
  feedback is resolved.
- **Reply to reviewers after pushing a fix.** Reply on the
  corresponding review thread with an **@-mention**
  (`@gemini-code-assist` / `@coderabbitai`). Silent fixes are
  invisible to reviewers and cost the audit trail.
- A review thread is **settled** the moment the latest bot reply
  is ack-only ("Thank you" / "Understood" / a re-review summary
  with no new findings) or 30 minutes elapse with no actionable
  comment.
- **Merge gate**: review bots quiet AND owner explicit approval.
- Bot-authored PRs (Renovate / Dependabot) skip the bot-review
  gate; CI green + owner approval is enough.

### Worktree workflow

Use [`renri`](https://github.com/yukimemi/renri) for any
commit-bound change. From the main checkout:

```sh
renri add <branch-name>            # create a worktree (jj-first)
renri --vcs git add <branch-name>  # force a git worktree
renri remove <branch-name>         # cleanup after merge
renri prune                        # GC stale worktrees
```

Read-only inspection can stay on the main checkout.

### kata-managed sections

Several files in this repo are managed by `kata apply` from the
[`yukimemi/pj-presets`](https://github.com/yukimemi/pj-presets)
templates — the bytes between `<!-- kata:*:begin -->` and
`<!-- kata:*:end -->` markers, plus the overwrite-always files
listed in `.kata/applied.toml`. **Editing those bytes locally
won't survive the next `kata apply`** — push the change to the
upstream template repo (`yukimemi/pj-base` / `yukimemi/pj-rust` /
…) instead. The marker scopes are layered:

- `kata:agents:base:*` — language-agnostic conventions (this section).
- `kata:agents:rust:*` — added when `pj-rust` applies.
- `kata:agents:rust-cli:*` — added when `pj-rust-cli` applies.

### Rust workflow

This repo follows the yukimemi/* Rust toolchain conventions. The
language-agnostic conventions block above (`kata:agents:base:*`)
covers git workflow, PR review cycle, and worktree usage.

### Build / lint / test

```sh
cargo make check                    # fmt --check + clippy + test + lock-check (the pre-push gate)
cargo make setup                    # one-time hook install + apm install
cargo build                         # debug build
cargo build --release               # release build
cargo test                          # tests; add -- --nocapture for stdout
```

`cargo make check` is what `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs and what
the local pre-push hook calls — anything that passes locally
should pass on CI and vice versa. Don't paper over a failing
clippy by sprinkling `#[allow(clippy::...)]`; fix the underlying
issue or push back on the lint with reasoning.

### Toolchain pin

The Rust toolchain is pinned via `rust-toolchain.toml` and the
project compiles with the `stable` channel. Don't introduce
nightly-only features without a real reason; if you do, document
the reason in the relevant module.

### Lint / format policy

`rustfmt.toml` and `clippy.toml` are kata-managed (sourced from
`yukimemi/pj-rust`). Edits to those files in this repo won't
survive the next `kata apply`; if a setting is wrong, push the
fix to `yukimemi/pj-rust` so every yukimemi/* Rust project picks
it up.

### CI workflow

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` is also kata-managed. The source lives
in `yukimemi/pj-rust/.github/workflows/ci.yml.template` (the
`.template` suffix keeps GitHub Actions from running the source
itself in pj-rust); each Rust project receives the rendered
`ci.yml` via `kata apply`. Action versions are bumped centrally
by Renovate at `yukimemi/pj-rust` and propagate down on the next
apply, so don't bump them locally — Renovate is configured
(via the kata-distributed `renovate.json`) to ignore
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `.github/workflows/release.yml`
in each PJ to avoid the bump→clobber loop.

### Rust library release flow

This is a Rust **library** crate, so the release pipeline is
publish-only: a successful tag push runs `cargo publish` to
crates.io and stamps the matching GitHub release page with
auto-generated notes. **No binaries** are uploaded — the
canonical artifact for a library is the `crates.io` tarball;
the GH release page exists for historical visibility and so
Renovate's release-notes manager (and any other tooling that
consumes GitHub Releases) has something to find.

```sh
# Bump `package.version` in Cargo.toml (run `cargo build` so
# Cargo.lock follows), then:
git commit -am "chore: bump version to X.Y.Z"
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z"
git push origin main vX.Y.Z
```

The workflow then:
1. Creates a GitHub Release at the tag with auto-generated
   notes (PRs since the previous tag).
2. `cargo publish --locked` to crates.io using the
   `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` repo secret.

Set the `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` secret once per repo (`gh secret
set CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`) before the first tag push. If the
crate is internal-only and shouldn't go to crates.io, drop the
`publish` job locally (release.yml is `when = "once"` so the
edit survives subsequent applies) or set `package.publish = false`
in `Cargo.toml`.

### MSRV / SemVer caveats for library authors

Unlike CLIs (where lockfile-pinned versions are what users
consume), libraries publish version *ranges* in their downstream
projects' `Cargo.toml` files. Two things to keep in mind when
bumping:

- **MSRV signalling.** Setting `package.rust-version` in
  `Cargo.toml` tells cargo the minimum Rust this crate will
  build with. Bump it deliberately (e.g. when adopting a stable
  feature that requires a newer toolchain) and call out the bump
  in the release notes — downstream pinning their own MSRV
  needs the visibility.
- **`rangeStrategy` in renovate.json.** This template inherits
  pj-rust's `rangeStrategy: "bump"`, which is right for binary
  crates but raises the MSRV ceiling for library downstreams
  more than necessary. If a downstream of this library
  complains, override locally with `rangeStrategy: "replace"`
  (and consider whether the broader yukimemi/* default should
  flip — track upstream).

### `cargo publish --dry-run`

Before pushing a tag, validate the publish step locally with
`cargo make publish-dry` (defined by pj-rust). Catches metadata
issues — missing `description`, `license`, `repository`,
`readme` — that crates.io rejects on the actual publish.
